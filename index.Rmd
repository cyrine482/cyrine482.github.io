<h1 style="text-align: center;">Bio</h1>
I am an agronomic engineer fueled by my passion for understanding the nuances of the interface of sustainability, food security, ecology and global health, I consider myself a life-long learner eager to both build on my academic foundations in agronomy and fisheries and stay in tune with the information processing techniques and modelling.
